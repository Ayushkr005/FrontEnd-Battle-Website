## Key features

This project is packed with features that demonstrate a wide range of front-end development skills:

### Multi-Page Layout & E-Commerce Flow:

- Homepage (index.html): A comprehensive landing page with multiple sections to introduce the company.

- Services Detail Page (services-detail.html): An in-depth look at the company's "BSS/OSS Capabilities" with an auto-playing, interactive tab system and detailed UI mockups.
- Checkout Page (payment.html): A secure and clean checkout page that pulls items from localStorage, validates user input, and simulates a payment process.

### Interactive UI/UX Components:

- Dynamic Modals: A generic modal system for displaying details, plus a custom-styled "Resource Modal" for testimonials and pricing.
- Interactive Tabs: Two distinct tab systems‚Äîone on the homepage and a more advanced, auto-switching version on the services detail page.
- Dynamic Portfolio Slider: A case study slider that dynamically updates content, images, and links.
- Client Testimonial Carousel: A sleek, auto-playing carousel for client feedback.
- Shopping Cart: "Add to Cart" functionality that uses localStorage to persist data across pages, with a live-updating cart counter.
- Clickable Elements with Tooltips: Nearly every interactive element provides a descriptive tooltip on hover using the data-info attribute.

### Sophisticated Animations & Effects:
- Preloader: An animated logo and progress bar on initial page load.
- On-Scroll Animations: Elements elegantly fade and slide into view as the user scrolls, powered by the IntersectionObserver API.
